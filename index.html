  Education
</h3>

<ul>
<li>
  PhD in Mathematical Modelling in Biology, University of Leicester 2014- 2018
  <ul>
    <strong> Study Subject:</strong> In the first year, I have studied plankton dynamics in space with different parametrisation of functional responses. We have published one paper and I have led seminars related to this subject. After the first year, we have started bacteriophage model in well-mixed space and heterogeneous space. We have also published a paper on this subject. In addition, I have presented the poster and talk on this subject at some conferences.

  Teaching Skills
</h3>
<ul>
  I am working as an academic at Corum Hitit University since 2019 and I have training related to teaching and providing formative feedback. I have improved my teaching skills while working as a teaching assistant and as a volunteer at University of Leicester

  Time Management
</h3>
<ul>
  Completing PhD within 3 years is very important and I did. I have also published three SCI papers and we will publish a paper soon. I did my PhD with teaching and invigilation.
